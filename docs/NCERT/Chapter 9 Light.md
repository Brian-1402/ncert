## Short answer questions
1. State the laws of reflection.
   Ans:
   1) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, 
   2) The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.
   
2. Properties of reflected image by a plane mirror.
   Ans:
   - Image formed by a plane mirror is always virtual and erect.
   - The size of the image is equal to that of the object.
   - The image formed is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. 
     Or, distance b/w image and mirror = distance b/w object and mirror.
   - The image is laterally inverted.
3. What is diffraction of light.
   Ans:
   If an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small, light has a tendency to bend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of light.
4. Define spherical mirrors, concave and convex mirrors.
   Ans: 
   - Mirrors whose reflecting surfaces are spherical are called spherical mirrors.
   - A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards, that is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror. 
   - A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called a convex mirror. 
     
     *Tip: Don't forget to mention that it is a "spherical mirror" when defining concave and convex mirrors.*
5. Define and state the features of centre of curvature. 
   Ans:
   - The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere. This sphere has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror.
   - The centre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting surface.
   - For a concave mirror, centre of curvature lies in front of it. However, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror.
6. Define pole of a mirror.
   Ans:
   - The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is a point called the pole. 
   - It lies on the surface of the mirror.
7. Give two definitions for radius of curvature.
   Ans:
   1) *(main definition)* The radius of the sphere of which the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius of curvature of the mirror.
   2) The line distance between the pole and centre of curvature of the mirror.
8. Define principal axis of a mirror.
   Ans:
   - An imaginary straight line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror is called the principal axis.
   - The principal axis is normal (At 90°) to the mirror at its pole.
9. Define principal focus of concave and convex mirror.
   Ans:
   - *Incident* rays parallel to the principal axis, after reflecting, intersect at a point on the principal axis. This point is the principal focus of concave mirror.
   - *Incident* rays parallel to the principal axis, after reflecting, appear to emerge from a point on the principal axis. This point is the principal focus of concave mirror.
	 
	 *Tip: Here, the parallel rays must be mentioned as incident rays as well, because rays being parallel while incident (before reflecting) and rays being parallel while reflected (after reflection) are two different cases*
1. Define focal length.
    Ans: 
    The distance between the pole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called the focal length. It is represented by the letter $f$.
11. Define aperture.
    Ans:
    The diameter (length between two opposite ends) of the reflecting surface of spherical mirror is called its aperture.
12. The relationship between radius of curvature and focal length.
    Ans:
	*For spherical mirrors of small apertures,* the radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We put this as $R = 2f$.
13. What is the condition required for $R = 2f$ to hold, for a spherical mirror?
    Ans:
    The aperture of the spherical mirror should be much smaller compared to the radius of curvature.
14. Where is the principal focus located, 1) in terms of center of curvature, 2) in terms of effect of mirror on rays of light?
    Ans:
    1) Principal focus of a spherical mirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature.
    2) Point on principal axis where parallel incident rays of light meet or appear to emerge from, after reflection from concave or convex mirror respectively.
15. Uses of concave mirrors and the property used behind it.
    Ans:
    - Torches, search-lights or headlights - to get powerful parallel beams of light - using rays starting from focus reflecting to become parallel rays.
    - Shaving mirrors, dental mirrors - makes use of enlarged virtual image when object is placed between focus and pole. 
    - Focus sunlight for heating - uses the principle of parallel rays of light reflected and converging to principal focus.
16. Uses of convex mirrors and the property used behind it.
    Ans:
    - rear-view mirrors - object at finite distance produces diminished virtual image, and hence shows wider range of view on a smaller area (within the mirror's aperture).
17. Define the mirror formula and its purpose.
    Ans:
    - *(you should always state the meaning of the variables when defining formulas)*
      Let u be the distance of the object from its pole, called the object distance. Let v be the distance of the image from the pole of the mirror, called the image distance. Let f be the focal length. The signs of the variables are according to the spherical mirror sign convention.
	  - The formula is: $$\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$$
	  - It is possible 
18. Define magnification and it's formula.
   Ans:
	- Magnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to which the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size. 
	- It is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object.
$$m = \frac{Height \; of \; the \; image \; (h')}{Height \; of \; the \; object \; (h)}$$
$$m = \frac{h'}{h}$$
19. What is the relation between the sign of magnification and whether the image is real or virtual?
    Ans:
    - Negative magnification - real.
    - Positive magnification - virtual.
20. Give the formula for magnification in terms of i) heights from axis, ii) distances from origin.
    Ans:
    - with heights:
$$m = \frac{Height \; of \; the \; image \; (h')}{Height \; of \; the \; object \; (h)}$$
	- with distances: $$ m = - \frac{v}{u} $$
21. Define refraction.
    Ans: When travelling **obliquely** from one medium to another, the direction of propagation of light in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as refraction of light.
22. What is the manner in which light bends, between mediums of different optical density?
    Ans: 
    - Rarer to denser medium - refracted ray bends towards the normal.
    - Denser to rarer medium - refracted ray bends away from the normal.
    *(Hint: Think of it as this: in denser medium, light is slower. so for light to "catch up", it bends towards normal to travel less oblique and more straight, to cover less distance. Vice versa for denser to rarer, it got too fast so to cover less distance in that time, it travels more bent.) Of course this is not a completely accurate analogy but it helps to give an intuition, instead of byhearting that "lesser to denser = bend towards normal" etc.*
23. State the laws of refraction.
24. Define refractive index between two mediums and it's formula. Also give formula for absolute refractive index of a single medium.
25. Explain what is optical density.
26. State the two types of spherical lenses and 2 of their properties each.
27. What is special about the optical centre of a spherical lens?
28. Define i) centres of curvature, ii) principal axis, iii) optical centre, iv) aperture, v) principal foci, vi) focal length.
29. What is the method to locate the principal focus of a convex lens?

3. State the 4 important different ways in which rays reflect off concave mirrors.
