## Tips:
### Quick verifications
- A great way to be confident about your answers is to know some simple steps of verifications. There are countless ones you can try all the time.
  For example, for long division, you can check by finding quotient $\times$ divisor + remainder and it should be equal to the dividend in the question. Of course, this is time taking but not as time taking as the division itself. But even if that's too much, some more smaller checks can be done like multiplying just the 1s digit, and adding the 1s digit with the 1s digit of the remainder, and it should match with 1s digit of dividend. 
  If the 1s digit is 0 when multiplying, first divide that number by 10 (till no 0) and then proceed to verify. Here you'd basically be verifying the 10s digit or greater.
  The point of these checks is that they should be easy enough to be done mentally in a few seconds, while not complete enough to fully verify your answer. But more small checks you do, more you'll feel reassured that your answer is probably correct and you can trust yourself to move on to the next question.
### Prime factorization
- You should already know this, that it's easiest to start by checking divisibility with 2,3,5,10 using those divisibility rules. Divisibility with 2,5,10 should be evident immediately, by looking at the 1s digit. Later try for 3. 
### HCF/LCM applications
- If in a situational question they ask something like "largest/highest/greatest", then good chance they are looking for HCF, so think in that perspective first. Vice versa for LCM.


## Types of questions: Easy
#### Check if $x^n$ ends with 0
- More generalized: check if (product of numbers, any combination) ends with (any easily noticable single digit, like 2, 5, 0)
- Get $x^n$ to be in the most factorized form, prove that there is no $2 \times 5$ present, in the case of checking ends with 0. Similarly for ends with 5, even numbers, etc.
#### Find HFC and LCM for x and y using prime factorization
- Method: HFC method individually and LCM method.
- Some shortcuts to verify:
	- if you have found the answer, but not sure, you can confirm your answer by checking if $x \times y = HCF \times LCM$ 
	- Be sure to use faster verifications like multiplying over the 1s digit only, etc.
#### Find just HFC of x and y, and using HFC, find LCM without factorizing again.
- Use $x \times y = HCF \times LCM$ 
#### Find HFC and LCM of 3 numbers x, y, z
- HFC and LCM method as usual.
- Note that the earlier checking step of $x \times y = HCF \times LCM$ won't work here.
#### Explain why x is a composite number, x is some combination of numbers.
- Usually can factorise out a number easily from the form x is in.
#### Application questions requiring HCF or LCM
- Need to read and understand whether they need HFC or LCM. Usually "maximum/largest" refers to HFC, coz of "Highest Common Factor". And "Minimum/least" refers to LCM. These are just hints though, may not always be true, should properly read the question to be sure.
#### Prove $\sqrt{x}$ is irrational.
- Do the usual $\sqrt{x} = \frac{a}{b}$, square both sides, use the prime divides $a^2$  if it divides $a$ theorem on both $a$ and $b$, contradict both of them being coprime.
#### Prove $c + d\sqrt{x}$ is irrational. 
- Combination of proving first that $\sqrt{x}$ is irrational, then rearranging $c + d\sqrt{x} = \frac{a}{b}$ to get $\sqrt{x} = \frac{a-bc}{bd}$ and get proof by contradiction.

## Types of questions: Hard
#### Two numbers have ratio $a:b$ and LCM is $l$. Find HCF.
- Represent the numbers as $a \cdot x$ and $b \cdot x$. Since $a$ and $b$ are coprime, $x$ turns out to be HCF by nature (might need a better explanation/proof why). Consequently, LCM will be of the form $l = a \cdot b \cdot x$. You have the value for $l$, $a$, $b$.
