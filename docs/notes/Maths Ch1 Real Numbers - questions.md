Notes: Also write down the 1s digit multiplication verification steps wherever needed. Helps to confirm your answers quickly.

### Main question set: 21 marks
- (2 marks) HCF and LCM of (420,105).
- (1 mark) Find HCF and LCM of 7 and 19, without factorizing or table method. Explain why those are not needed. 
- (3 marks) Do prime factorization on each of these:
	a) 132, b) 5037, c) 680
- (2 marks) Given that HCF (143, 154) = 11, find LCM (143, 154).
- (4 marks) Find HCF of 
	a) (42, 147, 210),    b) (81, 54, 243)
- (2 marks) Prove 1 + $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational. (Assume $\sqrt{3}$ is already proven to be irrational)
- (3 marks) Check whether $7^n$ ends with 5 for some number $n$.
- (4 marks) Find the LCM of the following integers by applying both the prime factorization method and "LCM table method":
	a) (12,15,21)   b) (15,9,25)

### Harder questions: 19 marks
(If you get these, that's pretty awesome)
- (3 marks) For 2 numbers $x$ and $y$, HCF = 10, LCM = 420. if $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{14}{3}$, then find $x$ and $y$.
- (3 marks) For two numbers $x$ and $y$, represent them in terms of their HCF $h$. Similarly, represent LCM using $h$ and using the earlier representations. Hint: Think about representing using arbitrary coprime pairs $a$, $b$.
- (3 marks) For 2 numbers $x$ and $y$, HCF = 21, and $x:y = 11:10$, then find LCM.
- There are two race tracks which are 30m and 25m long. 
	- (2 marks) What is the length of the longest rod I can use to measure both the tracks perfectly? By perfectly I mean, I can say "track A is exactly as long as n rods" where n is natural number.
	- (3 marks) A relay race is being conducted on both these tracks separately. (Assume relay race means people switch directions at each end).
	  To judge races on both tracks fairly (total distance covered by a team in both tracks separately, is the same), what should be the minimum total distance that the race should go on for?
- (5 marks) Prove 5 + $\frac{2}{\sqrt{14}}$ is irrational. Hint: need to prove $\sqrt{14}$ is irrational too.
- (??? marks) Prove that $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$ is irrational. (Assume $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$ are irrational).
