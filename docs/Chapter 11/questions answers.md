### Short answer type

1. Basic definition of electric circuit.
	- A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an electric circuit.
2. Definition of electric current and it's direction.
	- The amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time is called electric current.
	- It is the rate of flow of electric charges.
	- It's direction is the direction of flow of positive charges.
3. Relation between direction of current and flow of electrons.
	- Conventionally, in an electric circuit the direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons, which are negative charges.
4. Formal definition of electric current in terms of charge and time.
	- If a net charge Q, flows across any cross-section of a conductor in time t, then the current I, through the cross-section is $I = \frac{Q}{t}$
5. Define the SI unit of charge.
	- 1 Coulomb (C) is defined as the charge contained in nearly $6 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.
6. Amount of charge in a single electron.
	- $1.6 \times 10^{â€“19} \; C$
7. Define Ampere.
	- One ampere is constituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is, 1 A = 1 C/1 s.
8. Which device is used to measure current? How is it used?
	- Ammeter.
	- It is connected in series to the circuit to be measured.
9. Define electric potential difference and its formula.
	- The electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current is the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other.
	- Potential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)
	- SI unit is volt (V).
10. Define 1 volt.
	- One volt is the potential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one point to the other.
	- $1 \; volt \; = \; \frac{1 \; joule}{1 \; coulomb}$
	- $1 \; V = 1 \; J C^{-1}$
11. How is current produced in a circuit?
	- When a cell is connected to a conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in motion in the conductor and produces an electric current.
12. Explain about voltmeter.
	- The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called the voltmeter. 
	- The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the points between which the potential difference is to be measured.
13. State Ohm's law and it's formula.
	- The potential difference, V, across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided its temperature remains the same.
	- $V \alpha \; I$
	- $V \; = \; I \cdot R$
14. Define resistance.
	- It is the property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it.
	- SI unit is Ohm ($\Omega$).
15. Define SI unit of resistance.
	- If the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V and the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor is 1 $\Omega$.
	- $1 \; ohm \; = \; \frac{1 \; volt}{1 \; ampere}$
