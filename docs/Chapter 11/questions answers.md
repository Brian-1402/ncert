1. Basic definition of electric circuit.
	- A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an electric circuit.
2. Definition of electric current and it's direction.
	- The amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time is called electric current.
	- It is the rate of flow of electric charges.
	- It's direction is the direction of flow of positive charges.
3. Relation between direction of current and flow of electrons.
	- Conventionally, in an electric circuit the direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons, which are negative charges.
4. Formal definition of electric current in terms of charge and time.
	- If a net charge Q, flows across any cross-section of a conductor in time t, then the current I, through the cross-section is $I = \frac{Q}{t}$
5. Define the SI unit of charge.
	- 1 Coulomb (C) is defined as the charge contained in nearly $6 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.
6. Amount of charge in a single electron.
	- $1.6 \times 10^{–19} \; C$
7. Define Ampere.
	- One ampere is constituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is, 1 A = 1 C/1 s.
8. Which device is used to measure current? How is it used?
	- Ammeter.
	- It is connected in series to the circuit to be measured.
9. Define electric potential difference and its formula.
	- The electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current is the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other.
	- Potential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)
	- SI unit is volt (V).
10. Define 1 volt.
	- One volt is the potential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one point to the other.
	- $1 \; volt \; = \; \frac{1 \; joule}{1 \; coulomb}$
	- $1 \; V = 1 \; J C^{-1}$
11. How is current produced in a circuit?
	- When a cell is connected to a conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in motion in the conductor and produces an electric current.
12. Explain about voltmeter.
	- The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called the voltmeter. 
	- The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the points between which the potential difference is to be measured.
13. State Ohm's law and it's formula.
	- The potential difference, V, across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided its temperature remains the same.
	- $V \alpha \; I$
	- $V \; = \; I \cdot R$
14. Define resistance.
	- It is the property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it.
	- SI unit is Ohm ($\Omega$).
15. Define SI unit of resistance.
	- If the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V and the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor is 1 $\Omega$.
	- $1 \; ohm \; = \; \frac{1 \; volt}{1 \; ampere}$
16. What is a rheostat?
	- It is a resistor whose resistance can be varied.
	- Used to regulate current without changing the voltage source.
17. Properties of the conductor that resistance is dependent on.
	- length
	- cross section area
	- nature of material
18. Give formula of resistance in terms of conductor properties.
	- $R \; = \; \rho \frac{l}{A}$
	- Where $\rho$ (rho) is a constant of proportionality, $l$ is length, $A$ is cross section area.
19. Properties of series combination of resistors:
	- The current is the same in every part of the series circuit.
	- The total potential difference across a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential difference across the individual resistors. $V = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$ in the case of three resistors in series.
	- The resistance of the combination $R_s$ equals the sum of their individual resistances, $R_1 + R_2 + R_3$.
20. Properties of resistors in parallel.
	- Voltage across each parallel resistor is the same.
	- The total current $I$, is equal to the sum of the separate currents through each branch of the combination. $I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3$.
	- The reciprocal of the equivalent resistance of a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances.
	- $\frac{1}{R_{p}} = \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} + \frac{1}{R_3}$
21. Disadvantages of series circuit.
	- The different components connecting in series might need different values of current to operate, but in series they are forced to have the same value of current.
	- When one component fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.
22. Advantages of parallel circuit.
	- Each component can have the differing amount of current they need.
	- Failure of one component doesn't break the entire circuit.
	- Overall resistance of the system decreases.
23. Relation between heat produced by resistor and the circuit values.
	- directly proportional to the square of current for a given resistance.
	- directly proportional to resistance for a given current.
	- directly proportional to the time for which the current flows through the resistor.
24. When voltage is fixed, to produce more heat from a resistor, do we increase resistance or decrease resistance?
	- We decrease resistance, because in this scenario, power is inversely related to resistance.
	- Use formula: $P = V^2/R$
	- Tip: we do not use the $P = I^2R$ formula here because we now have to deal with two variables, $I$ and $R$. As we change R to decide best value for max heat, I also changes accordingly, so calculating P gets confusing. But if we use earlier formula of V and R, here V stays constant and we can just change R to directly calculate value of P.
25. Practical uses of Joules heating effect.
	- Heating appliances like kettle, toaster, heater, oven etc.
	- Light generated via heat, example: light bulb.
	- Fuse.
26. Define SI unit of power.
    - The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by a device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference of 1 V.
    - 1 W = 1 volt × 1 ampere = 1 V A.
