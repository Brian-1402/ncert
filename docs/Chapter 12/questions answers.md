## Magnetism

1. Define magnetic field.
	- Definition 1 (simpler, use this) The region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected, is said to have a magnetic field.
	- Definition 2 (more accurate) The effect which produces the force of the magnet in the region surrounding it is called a magnetic field.
	- Definition 3 (even more accurate) The physical entity, present in the region surrounding a magnet, which causes effects of magnetism such as force exerted on objects around it, is called a magnetic field.
2. Properties of magnetic field:
	- Has both direction and magnitude.
	- strength of the field is higher where the field lines are crowded.
3. Properties of magnetic field lines (can also be included under the previous question)
	- Has both direction and magnitude.
	- strength of the field is higher where the field lines are crowded.
	- No two field lines can intersect. 
	- Magnetic field lines are closed curves.
	- *Outside the magnet*, field lines emerge from north pole and merge at the south pole. *And inside the magnet*, they go from south pole to north pole.
4. Relation between electric current in a wire and the magnetic field produced by it.
	- magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given point increases as the current through the wire increases. (directly proportional to current strength)
	- magnetic field produced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance from it increases. (inversely proportional to distance from wire)
	- If there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is n times as large as that produced by a single turn. (Actually this is a result of point 1, but worth mentioning)
5. State the right hand thumb rule.
	- Imagine holding a current-carrying straight conductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards the direction of current. Then your fingers will wrap around the conductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field.
6. What is the alternative form of the right hand thumb rule?
	- It's also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a corkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of corkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field.
7. Define a solenoid.
	- A coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped closely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid.
8. What is the nature of magnetic field inside a solenoid?
	- The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of parallel straight lines. 
	- The magnetic field is the same at all points inside the solenoid, i.e., uniform inside the solenoid.
	- One end of the solenoid behaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the south pole.
9. What causes a magnet to exert a force on a current carrying conductor?
	- An electric current flowing through a conductor produces a magnetic field. The field so produced exerts a force on a magnet placed in the vicinity of the conductor. The magnet then exerts an equal and opposite force on the current-carrying conductor.
10. When is the force experienced by a current–carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field largest? (text)
	- Magnitude of the force is highest when the direction of current is at right angles to the direction of the magnetic field.
11. How does the magnitude and direction of force exerted on the conductor relate to the directions of electric current and magnetic field.
	- Magnitude of the force is highest when the direction of current is at right angles to the direction of the magnetic field.
	- Direction of force is reversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed.
	- Direction of force is reversed when the direction of magnetic field through the conductor is reversed.
12. Describe Fleming's left hand rule.
	- stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular. If the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field and the second finger in the direction of current, then the thumb will point in the direction of motion or the force acting on the conductor.
13. Imagine that you are sitting in a chamber with your back to one wall. An electron beam, moving horizontally from back wall towards the front wall, is deflected by a strong magnetic field to your right side. What is the direction of magnetic field? Explain your reasoning (text)
14. Give one application of magnetism in the medical field.
	- MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), makes use of the faint amount of magnetic field produced by the body.
15. How does the earth wire work, what is it's purpose?
	- The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is usually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house. 
	- The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which provides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. 
	- It ensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance keeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe electric shock.
16. Purpose of a fuse
	- A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the appliances and the circuit due to overloading. 
17. When can overloading occur?
	- When the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact.
	- Too many appliances using the same socket.
	- Accidental hike in the supply voltage.
18. How does a fuse work?
	- When the current goes high beyond the limit of the fuse, Joule heating that takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit, stopping the flow of high electric current.
