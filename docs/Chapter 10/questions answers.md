## Reflection
### Short answer type

1. What is cornea?
	- Thin membrane on the surface of the eyeball through which light first enters the eye.
	- Forms a transparent bulge on the front of the surface of the eyeball.
2. Purpose of the cornea.
	- Most of the refraction of light rays entering the eye happens in the cornea.
3. Average size of eyeball.
	- 2.3cm in diameter. (1.15cm radius)
4. Iris and its purpose.
	- Dark, colored, muscular diaphragm that controls the amount of light entering the eye by changing the size of the pupil.
5. Pupil and its purpose.
	- Transparent opening of the eye for light to enter.
	- Can change size with the help of the iris to control the amount of light entering the eye.
6. Main purpose of lens.
	- Fine-tuned refraction and focusing of light rays to form inverted real image on the retina.
7. Structure of lens.
	- Crystalline, made of fibrous jelly like material. 
	- Surrounded by ciliary muscles to control curvature.
8. Retina and its purpose.
	- Retina is a delicate membrane having enormous number of light-sensitive cells.
	- Acts as a screen for the final real image to form.
	- Converts light image into electrical information and sends to the brain.
9. Explain accommodation and the mechanism of the lens.
	- The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called accommodation.
	- When the muscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length increases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly.
	- When the ciliary muscles contract, the curvature of the eye lens increases. The eye lens then becomes thicker. Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables us to see nearby objects clearly.
10. What is least distance?
	- 
### Long answer type

1. Explain the path of light through different parts of the eye to enable vision.
	- Light passes through cornea, get refracted a major amount.
	- Then enters through pupil, amount of rays restricted by the pupil size controlled by iris.
	- Passes through lens, whose curvature is controlled by ciliary muscles, light gets refracted in a more finer way.
	- Passes through vitreous humour present in the central volume of the eyeball to finally reach the retina.
	- Focused light rays fall on the retina to form an inverted real image. 
	- Optical nerve transports the visual information from the retina to the brain via electrical signals produced by the light sensitive cells on the retina.
	- The brain interprets these signals and processes the information so that we perceive objects as they are.
