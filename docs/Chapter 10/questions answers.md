### Short answer type

1. What is cornea?
	- Thin membrane on the surface of the eyeball through which light first enters the eye.
	- Forms a transparent bulge on the front of the surface of the eyeball.
2. Purpose of the cornea.
	- Most of the refraction of light rays entering the eye happens in the cornea.
3. Average size of eyeball.
	- 2.3cm in diameter. (1.15cm radius)
4. Iris and its purpose.
	- Dark, colored, muscular diaphragm that controls the amount of light entering the eye by changing the size of the pupil.
5. Pupil and its purpose.
	- Transparent opening of the eye for light to enter.
	- Can change size with the help of the iris to control the amount of light entering the eye.
6. Main purpose of lens.
	- Fine-tuned refraction and focusing of light rays to form inverted real image on the retina.
7. Structure of lens.
	- Crystalline, made of fibrous jelly like material. 
	- Surrounded by ciliary muscles to control curvature.
8. Retina and its purpose.
	- Retina is a delicate membrane having enormous number of light-sensitive cells.
	- Acts as a screen for the final real image to form.
	- Converts light image into electrical information and sends to the brain.
9. Explain accommodation and the mechanism of the lens.
	- The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called accommodation.
	- When the muscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length increases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly.
	- When the ciliary muscles contract, the curvature of the eye lens increases. The eye lens then becomes thicker. Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables us to see nearby objects clearly.
10. What is least distance?
	- The minimum distance, at which objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the least distance of distinct vision.
	- Also called near point.
11. Average value of least distance for a healthy eye.
	- 25cm.
12. What is far point and it's value for a healthy eye?
	- The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is called the far point of the eye.
	- Value is infinity.
13. What is cataract?
	- When the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and cloudy, this condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete loss of vision.
	- Vision can be restored via surgery.
14. Reasons for myopia.
	- Excessive curvature of the eye lens.
	- Elongation of the eyeball. (More common with myopia arising since childhood)
	- (bonus fact) Recent research shows that reason for rising number of myopia cases in the younger generation is linked to lack of outdoor sunlight exposure for the eyes during childhood. The role of sunlight is to slow down the growth of elongation of the eyeball (via generation of more dopamine in the retina), and the absence of this growth inhibition causes myopia. There's also additional link of myopia found when the eyes consistently focused on nearby objects for a major duration of the day, by being indoors and with increasing screen time.
15. Reasons for hypermetropia.
	- The focal length of the eye lens is too long.
	- The eyeball has become too small.
16. Purpose of concave and convex lens for fixing vision defects.
	- Concave lens fix myopia by bringing the image which was formed in front of the retina back to the proper position on the retina.
	- Convex lens fix hypermetropia by bringing the image which was formed in behind the retina back to the proper position on the retina.
17. What is presbyopia.
	- The decreasing accommodation power of the eye due to ageing is called presbyopia.
	- Near point gradually recedes away. Hypermetropia can also occur, making the person require bi-focal lenses.
18. Reasons for presbyopia.
	- Gradual weakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the eye lens, both due to old age.
20. What is angle of prism?
	- The angle between the two lateral faces of a prism is called the angle of the prism.
21. What is angle of deviation of prism?
	- Angle between emergent ray and incident ray.
22.  Spectrum:
	- The band of the coloured components of a light beam is called its spectrum.
23. Dispersion:
	- The splitting of light into its component colours is called dispersion.
24. How does a prism produce a spectrum?
	- Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray, as they pass through a prism. 
	- The red light bends the least while the violet the most. 
	- Thus the rays of each colour emerge along different paths and thus become distinct.
25. How to use two prisms to get emergent white light? / Explain Newton's experiment to prove sunlight consists of 7 colors.
	- Place the second prism in inverted position with respect to the first prism.
	- Make all emerging colors from first prism pass through 2nd prism.
	- Finally a beam of white light emerges from the 2nd prism.
26. Define a rainbow.
	- It is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky after a rain shower. It is caused by dispersion of sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the atmosphere.
	- (for higher marks questions, or simply to write extra info:) 
		- A rainbow is always formed in a direction opposite to that of the Sun. 
		- The water droplets act like small prisms
		- They refract and disperse the incident sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it again when it comes out of the raindrop.
27. Explain the shift in position of stars in the sky.
	- The refractive index of the atmosphere increases closer to the earth's surface, due to increasing density of air.
	-  Therefore, the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, and makes the apparent position of the star slightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the horizon.
28. State the effect of hot and cold air towards light.
	- The hotter air is lighter (less dense) than the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly less than that of the cooler air.
29. How do stars twinkle?
	- Since the stars are very distant, they approximate point-sized sources of light. 
	- The physical conditions of the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, this makes the path of rays of light coming from the star vary slightly. 
	- The apparent position of the star fluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers – the star sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which is the twinkling effect.
30. Why don't planets twinkle?
	- The planets are much closer to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources. 
	- If we consider a planet as a collection of a large number of point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the amount of light entering our eye from all the individual point-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby nullifying the twinkling effect.
31. Describe effect of atmospheric refraction on the sun.
	- The Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual sunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset because of atmospheric refraction.
	- Sun’s disc appears flattened during sunrise and sunset.
32. What is Tyndall effect?
	- The phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect.
33. Examples of Tyndall effect.
	- Visible fine beam of sunlight when it enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.
	- Beams of sunlight when it passes through a canopy of a dense forest.
34. Explain why the sky is blue.
	- The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end.
	- When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters our eyes.
35. (Bonus) Why is the sun red during sunset and sunrise, and whitish yellow at noon?
	- It is the result of the same blue light scattering effect of the atmosphere.
	- Compared to noon, during sunrise and sunset the path of light directly from the sun passing through the atmosphere is much longer due to the angle of incidence being more slanted.
	- So all the blue light gets scattered in all directions, while most of the red light continues to move in a straight path. So the image of the sun we see when directly looking at it is when all the short wavelength light has been scattered away and only long wavelength light remains.
	- At noon only a small amount of blue light gets scattered, since the path in the atmosphere is shorter, so most of the original white light enters our eyes.
36. Why are danger signs colored in red?
	- Red is least scattered by fog or smoke. Therefore, it can be seen in the same colour at a distance, and retains visibility the most.
	- (not needed) There is also the cultural significance of being the same color as fire and blood, but we don't need to mention that in a physics paper after all.
### Long answer type

1. Explain the path of light through different parts of the eye to enable vision.
	- Light passes through cornea, get refracted a major amount.
	- Then enters through pupil, amount of rays restricted by the pupil size controlled by iris.
	- Passes through lens, whose curvature is controlled by ciliary muscles, light gets refracted in a more finer way.
	- Passes through vitreous humour present in the central volume of the eyeball to finally reach the retina.
	- Focused light rays fall on the retina to form an inverted real image. 
	- Optical nerve transports the visual information from the retina to the brain via electrical signals produced by the light sensitive cells on the retina.
	- The brain interprets these signals and processes the information so that we perceive objects as they are.
2. Describe in detail the causes, issues, and fixes for myopia.
	- Also callsed near-sightedness.
	-  A person with myopia can see nearby objects clearly but cannot see distant objects distinctly. The far point nearer than infinity. 
	- In a myopic eye, the image of a distant object is formed in front of the retina and not at the retina itself. 
	- This defect may arise due to (i) excessive curvature of the eye lens, or (ii) elongation of the eyeball. 
	- This defect can be corrected by using a concave lens of suitable power to bring the image back on to the retina.
3. Describe in detail the causes, issues, and fixes for hypermetropia.
	- Also called far-sightedness.
	- A person with hypermetropia can see distant objects clearly but cannot see nearby objects distinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther away from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a person has to keep a reading material much beyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable reading. 
	- The light rays from a close by object are focused at a point behind the retina. 
	- This defect arises either because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is too long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small. 
	- This defect can be corrected by using a convex lens of appropriate power required for forming the image on the retina.
4. (Extra, for better clarity) How is it possible for both myopia and hypermetropia to occur on the same eye?
	- First, fundamentally myopia is an inability of lens to reduce curvature enough to produce image on retina, and for hypermetropia, inability of lens to increase curvature enough.
	- If you're thinking of both these defects purely in terms of the position of image in the eye (front of retina and behind the retina) then it might feel contradicting for both to happen at the same time.
	- But actually both these defects are happening in opposite and mutually exclusive situations. An object's image can't form on both the front and the back of the retina at the same time. The situations are different for closer and faraway objects.
	- So now, when it comes to the inability of lens to stretch/squeeze enough, it is possible for both inabilities to be present, for example when the lens get stiffer due to age and weakening of ciliary muscles. So the overall bending performance of the lens is reduced, for both stretching and squeezing, so you can have myopia and hypermetropia at the same time. Just that you cannot observe effects of myopia and hypermetropia on the same object at the same distance.
