These are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end.</li> <li>When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters our eyes.</li> </ul> </li> <li>(Bonus) Why is the sun red during sunset and sunrise, and whitish yellow at noon?<ul> <li>It is the result of the same blue light scattering effect of the atmosphere.</li> <li>Compared to noon, during sunrise and sunset the path of light directly from the sun passing through the atmosphere is much longer due to the angle of incidence being more slanted.</li> <li>So all the blue light gets scattered in all directions, while most of the red light continues to move in a straight path. So the image of the sun we see when directly looking at it is when all the short wavelength light has been scattered away and only long wavelength light remains.</li> <li>At noon only a small amount of blue light gets scattered, since the path in the atmosphere is shorter, so most of the original white light enters our eyes.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Why are danger signs colored in red?<ul> <li>Red is least scattered by fog or smoke.

An object's image can't form on both the front and the back of the retina at the same time. The situations are different for closer and faraway objects.</li> <li>So now, when it comes to the inability of lens to stretch/squeeze enough, it is possible for both inabilities to be present, for example when the lens get stiffer due to age and weakening of ciliary muscles. So the overall bending performance of the lens is reduced, for both stretching and squeezing, so you can have myopia and hypermetropia at the same time.

Trying values like 1,2,3,4 etc. we see that the pair (1,3) satisfies the formulas for \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).

Here, a is 4, d is -1.</p> <p>8) Lets look at the series of numbers divisible by 7:    7, 14, 21, 28, ...    If you notice, it is actually an AP. As a general fact, all your multiplication tables are APs. So the multiples of 7 is AP with d = 7, multiples of 5 is an AP with d = 5, and so on.    If the entire series of multiples of 7 is an AP, then any subsequence/section of the series is also an AP, with same d. In this question, we are looking at the section of just the 2 digit numbers among the multiples of 7.     (More explanation for understanding: Think of it like, writing all the multiples of 7, then removing all the numbers which are not 2 digit. We would remove 1 digit numbers, and 3 digit and above. We don't have to remove any number in between the 2 digits, otherwise the AP series will break and no longer be an AP. So as long as we don't remove anything in the middle, just stuff at the start or at the end, then things are fine, our remaining set of numbers is still an AP.)    So for multiples of 7, we know that d = 7. What we want to find is n for the AP. The AP starts with the smallest 2 digit multiple of 7, and ends with the largest 2 digit multiple of 7.     \\(a = 14\\), \\(a_{n} = 7*14=98\\).    We got \\(a\\), \\(a_n\\), \\(d\\). From this we can figure out \\(n\\).    \\(a + (n-1)d = a_n\\) \\(14 + (n-1)7 = 98\\) \\((n-1)7 = 84\\) \\((n-1)=\\frac{70+14}{7}= 10 + 2 = 12\\) (See what I did there? instead of directly 84/7, I split 84 into easier to divide chunks, so can do mentally faster. Just a helpful tip, in case you didn't already know) \\(n = 13\\)</p> <p>9) Judging by the way the pressure increases in a fixed amount per each meter deep, we can tell that the pressure values form an AP.     Lets look at pressure at every integer meter. Let h be the depth level, P be the pressure.    At h = 0m, P = 1 atm (Because we are at the surface, regular atmospheric pressure)    At h = 1m, P = 1.1 atm (Increases by 0.1 atm per meter downward)    At h = 2m, P = 1.2 atm</p> <p>So there is an AP here for values of P. We will start counting at h = 0. So first element of the AP, \\(a = a_{1} = 1\\) at h = 0, \\(a_{2} = 1.1\\) at h = 1, \\(a_{3} = 1.2\\) at h = 2.     If you notice, for \\(n^{th}\\) value of AP \\(a_n\\), h is equal to n-1. So after we find value of n, to get value of h, we do h = n-1. Just to remember to apply this in the end.</p> <p>Moving on to solve the AP,     \\(a = 1, a_{n} = 4, d = 0.1\\) \\(a + (n-1)d = a_n\\) \\(1 + (n-1) \\cdot 0.1 = 4\\) \\((n-1) \\cdot 0.1 = 3\\) \\((n-1) = 30\\) \\(n = 31\\)    As established earlier, h = n-1.     Final h required: h = 31 - 1 = 30.    The diver can dive 30 meters deep without risking nitrogen narcosis.</p>"},{"location":"notes/Maths%20ch5%20AP%20-%20part%202/","title":"Maths ch5 AP   part 2","text":"<p>Total 21 marks</p> <p>1) (1 mark) Check whether 301 is a term of the list of numbers 5, 11, 17, 23, ..
